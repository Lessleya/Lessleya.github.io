        <h2>Week 02: Design Principles</h2>
        <p>This assignment has you plan and develop a design principles web page which you will publish and link to from your assignment portal home page. The objectives of the assignment are for you: 1) to recognize and identify favorable design principles
            in existing sites, 2) to recognize the application of responsive design on live sites, and 3) practice developing a valid HTML/CSS page using CSS Grid in the layout. You will be asked to replicate a particular page layout in three different
            views using your own colors and typography choices</p>

            <h2>The Rule of thirds</h2>
            <h3>Tesla</h3>
            <p>In this picture the rule of thirds is applying by placing a simple grid overlay (divided equally into thirds, both horizontally and vertically) on the picture of the car. This makes a grid of nine equal-shaped boxes. The car is placed in one
                of the "sweet spots" where the eye will automatically fall towards the four intersection points </p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h3>Canva</h3>
            <p>The principle of repetition simply means the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout your design. In this website they use this principle by using the sema boxes for "Instagram posts" This repetition brings a clear sense of unity,
                consistency, and cohesiveness</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Elegant Themes</h3>
            <p>Contrast refers to the arrangement of opposite elements and effects. For example, in this website we have a strong constrast in light and dark colors, smooth and rough textures, large and small shapes. </p>
